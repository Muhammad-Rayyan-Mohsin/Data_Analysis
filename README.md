# Happiness Score Analysis

# Description:
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of happiness scores from the years 2015 to 2019 using Python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. The analysis includes outlier detection, extraction of specific information such as countries within certain health (life expectancy) ranges, identification of top-ranking countries, calculation of mean happiness scores, correlation analysis between happiness scores and other factors, and region-wise analysis based on economic indicators.

# Key Features:
- Outlier detection: The code detects outliers in different columns of the datasets for each year.
- Specific information extraction: It extracts countries with health (life expectancy) values falling within a certain range and identifies the top-ranking countries based on happiness scores.
- Mean happiness score calculation: It calculates the mean happiness score for a specified year.
- Correlation analysis: The code performs correlation analysis between happiness scores and various factors such as economy (GDP per capita), family, health (life expectancy), freedom, trust (government corruption), generosity, and dystopia residual.
- Region-wise analysis: It identifies regions with economy (GDP per capita) values less than a specified threshold for a given year.

This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing happiness scores over multiple years, offering a comprehensive understanding of global happiness trends.
